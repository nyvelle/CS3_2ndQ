	  <section>Classical music was evident in the year 1750s to 1830s. It is a musical form of the Western people, purposely played for monarchic events to symbolize luxury. Complex instruments such as violins, cellos, violas, pianos, harps, wind instruments such as flutes, basoon, etc. are commonly used in 
		creating classical music. These instruments are played in unison to create a beautiful harmony. Famous classical muscians include Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Johann Sebastian Bach.</section>

		<br><br>The ‘Sonata quasi una fantasia,’ now commonly known as the 'Moonlight Sonata', was Ludwig Van Beethoven's 14th piano sonata, Opus 27, Number 2. This composition was published during the 18th century and was famous for its complex yet relaxing melody.
		<br><br>The highlight behind Moonlight Sonata is Giulietta Guicciardi, Beethoven's 16-year-old lover and student. He planned to marry Guicciardi, but his father didn't allow their union due to Beethoven's low rank. Despite this despairing background, Moonlight Sonata still thrived to express and remember Beethoven's love for Guicciardi. </div>
